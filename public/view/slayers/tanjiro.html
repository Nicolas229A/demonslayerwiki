                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e3cc1bbf;">Quick Story:</span> After having his family be attacked by a demon by the time he was away from his house, only his sister Nezuko survived,
                after that Tanjiro decided to do anything in his power to try find a cure for her, then short after getting out their house, they were attacked by one of the Hashiras from the Demon Slayer Corps, Giyu Tomioka, who tried to kill Nezuko, but after seeing the demon girl try to protect her brother, Giyu decided to send them to his old master, Sakonji Urokodaki, who trained the boy for some years in Mt.Sagiri and sent him to the Mount Fujikasane for the Final Selection where Tanjiro finally became a Demon Slayer

                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e3cc1bbf;">Personality:</span> Tanjiro is a boy of a pure heart and soul, who is kind and described as having very gentle eyes and a compassionate persona, having the determination to do anything for those he loves and cares about.

              <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e3cc1bbf;">Abilities, equipment and fighting style:</span> Tanjiro is a sun breather, who has the capacity to use all the 13 forms, and also *other breathing* that were created from Sun Breathing, using a Nichirin Blade to perform the techniques, having also access to other
                incredible "powers" such as: Demon Slayer Mark, Bright Red Nichirin Blade, Transparent World and Selfless State, but his unique abilities are the Hard Skull and Enhanced Smell.

              <!--<p>
                Tanjiro looks remarkably similar in appearance to his ancestor
                Sumiyoshi, possessing the same facial structure, eyes, and
                hairstyle as him, although
                <a href="">Sumiyoshi's</a>
                hair was longer, about shoulder-length and would be tied in a
                ponytail behind his head.
