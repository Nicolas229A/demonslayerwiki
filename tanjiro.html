              <p>
                Appearance of the boy, who is also knowed as "Child of
                Brightness", yes the dude himself Kanpachiro Kamaboko, I mean
                Tanjiro...well it is in the title :
              </p>
              <p>
                Tanjiro is a young man of average height with fairly tanned skin
                and an athletic, muscular physique. He has ruffled, black hair
                with burgundy tips, combed back to expose his forehead, and
                wide, dark red eyes with white pupils that appear lighter around
                the lower section of his irises. He also has a scar on the top
                left of his forehead, first seen when his mother brought him to
                watch his father perform the Hinokami Kagura dance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scar originally looked somewhat like a graze until his fight
                with the Hand Demon during Final Selection, after which it
                develops into a flame-like pattern as his Demon Slayer Mark. It
                is noted that his hands are visibly rougher for someone his age,
                as a result of his rigorous training under Sakonji Urokodaki.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tanjiro looks remarkably similar in appearance to his ancestor
                Sumiyoshi, possessing the same facial structure, eyes, and
                hairstyle as him, although
                <a href="">Sumiyoshi's</a>
                hair was longer, about shoulder-length and would be tied in a
                ponytail behind his head.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tanjiro first appears wearing a checkered,
                black-and-sea-foam-green haori over a white robe and black
                pants. He occasionally sports a turquoise scarf and is seen with
                circular, white bands looped around his calves.
              </p>
              <p>
                He also wears a distinct pair of hanafuda earrings, with the
                image of the rising sun over a mountain.
              </p>
              <p>
                His hair is also kept tied back in small ponytail or bun; as he
                trains with Sabito and Makomo, his hair grows to his shoulders.
